I want to start off by saying that i know i have an accent and please don't assume it's russian. More and more people are complaining about the gotranscript test about the rules about the acceptance rate. And to be honest i pretty much had it with all this whining. First of all the test have. We've had so far where is it. All you had to do is listen carefully read our guidelines and do some research. These things are in the job description our clients don't always have good quality files so i may have background noise some might be in a difficult accent somewhere contain times you've never heard of. But we have to provide 9899 percent accuracy for all of our clients. Which try to make sure that our communication with employees and employers. Is a good one. Where are the edible on face. Skype live support email phone. We answer all kinds of questions regardless of how redundant they are or in some cases even rude. We have at least four ways of explaining how everything works. We tweak to the way we communicate information over and over again in the hope that it be clear for everyone and yet it's not. We're not one of those cold hearted companies that doesn't give a fuk about its employees. We work with people on a personal level which is why it's so frustrating for us to see the applicator test or account selling happening on gt. These things are so disrespectful i can't even begin to say. You know what. It's wrong on so many levels. I'm not over dramatic and i'm not overreacting. These things happen and we can't allow these kinds of behaviours within our company. You know what let me tell you a little story. Only three years ago this company got like three or four orders per week small ones. We were a handful of transcribers and we didn't have editors. And look where we are now. For someone who comes to us for the first time they think like. This site always look like this. This always had this many orders. We always have these rules this system in place all of our services and nobody. Hard stool. Really work hard to get where they are now. We worked our asses off. Will see you today has been done by a programmer and two jacks of all trades. We want day in and day out we didn't have time or 4 months. Where did something new everyday we did recently advertised we risked all of our savings for the company and it paid out. Now we got from 20 or less transcribers to 2000. We have over 500 editors. We hire all the time. We don't turn anyone down when they're asking for a chance. But what they do. Wizard chance is up to them.
